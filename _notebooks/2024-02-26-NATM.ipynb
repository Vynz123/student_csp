    "Our Team's idea for the CPT was to recreate spotify to learn skills that are applicable to the real world, and in a working product. We wanted to get the biggest feature of spotify, the playing songs feature, to work, and hoped to add in a few of our own kicks to the project."

    "Shubhay: Worked on a mixture of Front and Bakend. On the Frontend he developed the dynamic javascript and making the website resemble spotify. The Dynamics worked to reflexivly map through the lists of songs to make creating new songs easy. On the backend he devloped his portion of the songs model and api. Which was used to gain a list of songs, images, and song links that the API could map through. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tanvi: Worked on playing the songs. By developing the stucture of the songs database, she was able to get the song links to work properly and fetched them onto the frontend using their respective ID's. By developing the second half of the songs api, which was the /api/songs/[id] page we were able to individually grab the songs ID and play them when needed. Finnaly on the individual songs pages she grabbed the indivdual data of the song, and used it to create a play button that  plays or stops the song depending on the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tanay: Worked on the login page and frontend animations. On the frontend he made all the pages properly link together and used javascript to automatically pagnate the songs depending on how many songs their were. He used javascript to design all of the animations when clicking the songs. On the backend he developed the entire login functionality, and used it to spur future functionalities like liking and creating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pranavi: Worked on the songs individualistic pages, and the create function. Using a mix of javascript, and python she made it so when clicking on a song it automatically created a new web page with only that songs details being used.  By using the songs indivdual id's and the /api/song/[id] page the songs were able to indivually display themselves, and grabbed all the neccsary data. On the create function she made a form that users can fill and it posts to the songs database. "
