    "Our Team's idea for the CPT was to recreate spotify to learn skills that are applicable to the real world, and in a working product. We wanted to get the biggest feature of spotify, the playing songs feature, to work, and hoped to add in a few of our own kicks to the project."

    "Developed the feature to display all the songs and interact with them. Set up the /api/songs page on the backend to create a list of all the songs inorder to fetch them onto the frontend. On the frontend I mapped through this list and displayed all the songs reflexivly, and on the backend I created the model and API code for the backend to work. I developed the structure of the database to include a name, song image url, song mp3 url, and a token to act as a personal identifier of the song."
